## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Mark subtasks as complete and move tasks between columns
- Hide/show the board sidebar
- Toggle the theme between light/dark modes
- Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column

## My process

### Built with

- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) - An approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - Intuitive, type safe, light and flexible Store for Vue 3.
- [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) - The Most Complete Vue UI Component Library.
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - The official router for Vue.js.

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I have learned the following key points:

1. **Component-Based Development**: Vue.js emphasizes component-based development, breaking the UI into reusable components, resulting in a modular and maintainable codebase.

2. **Directives and Two-Way Data Binding**: Leveraging Vue.js directives like `v-model` for two-way data binding simplifies managing state and user input.

3. **PrimeVue Components**: PrimeVue provides a rich set of UI components like buttons, input fields, tables, and dialogs, offering a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

4. **Routing with Vue Router**: Implementing client-side routing using Vue Router enables navigation between different views in a single-page application effortlessly.

By incorporating these concepts and tools, I have been able to develop a robust and feature-rich application with Vue.js 3 and PrimeVue UI Library.

### Continued development

Firstly, I'm eager to delve deeper into Vue Router. While I have a foundational understanding of routing in Vue.js applications, I recognize the importance of exploring more advanced routing techniques such as nested routes and route guards. Strengthening my grasp of Vue Router will enable me to build more complex and dynamic single-page applications with confidence.

Component communication is also an area that I intend to refine. While I'm familiar with props, custom events, I see value in exploring more advanced communication patterns. Enhancing my understanding of component communication will enable me to build more modular and reusable components, contributing to cleaner and more maintainable codebases.

Other areas of focus include mastering the Vue CLI for more efficient project scaffolding and optimization, improving my testing skills to ensure robust and reliable Vue applications, prioritizing accessibility to make my applications inclusive to all users, and strengthening my error handling and debugging capabilities for smoother development workflows.

By prioritizing these areas in future projects, I'm confident that I'll continue to grow as a Vue.js developer and build even more impactful and innovative applications.

### Useful resources

- [VueJS guide](https://vuejs.org/guide) - Official VueJS documentation is a great resource to understand the core concepts of VueJS.
- [Prime Vue](https://primevue.org/introduction) - PrimeVue introduction and documentation is easy to understand and implement.
